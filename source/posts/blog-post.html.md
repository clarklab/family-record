Hey folks! This is Family Record, a simple way to archive family audio and video recordings. It's self-hosted, static-file-based, and completely customizable.

<a href="https://github.com/clarklab/family-record" class="button">Source on GitHub</a>

Here are some of the basic features:

* Supports audio and video files
* Simple content and blog tools built in
* Send a link, play the recording, no accounts or apps
* Great for in-laws and app-averse crowds

So how does this work under the hood? I'm glad you asked!

* Static site built by [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/)
* Source on [GitHub](https://github.com/clarklab/family-record), deployed and hosted by [Netlify](https://netlify.com) (both free)
* Works with MP3 (audio) and MP4 (video), more formats soon
* Mobile-ready, HTML-only media players
* Flat files, keep all you original recording files

This is a quick first release, keep an eye out for future releases. If you want to pitch in, contact <a href="https://twitter.com/clarklab">@clarklab</a>.
